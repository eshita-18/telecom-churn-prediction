# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction & Power BI Dashboard

A complete **Data Analytics + Machine Learning** project where I built a predictive model using Python (Random Forest) and translated insights into an interactive **Power BI dashboard**. This project simulates a real-world telecom use case to identify churn patterns and empower business decisions.

> ✅ **Goal**: Predict and reduce customer churn using data-driven storytelling.

## 🧠 Business Case

Telecom companies lose millions in revenue due to customer churn. This project helps:

- Predict which customers are likely to churn
- Understand **why** they churn (plan type, contract, service issues)
- Take **proactive actions** to retain high-value customers

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Based on simulated telecom customer data
- Fields include: demographics, usage behavior, billing, services, and churn status

## 📈 Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)

- **Features used**: Contract, Monthly Charges, Internet Service, Tenure, etc.
- **Target**: `Customer_Status` (Churned or Stayed)
- Achieved **~84% accuracy**
- Evaluated using Confusion Matrix and Classification Report
